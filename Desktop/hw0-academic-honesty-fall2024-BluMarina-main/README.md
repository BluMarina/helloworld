# Homework 0

This homework lets you get used to using Github and git.
It is also meant to ensure that we both understand what constitutes academic integrity for this class.

After you complete the **specification** below, make sure to run

```
$ sh final_commit.sh
$ git push
```

...while on the class' server for your final commit.

# Background

Some notes on academic integrity:

> Just as you can do a google search for code online, it is trivial for us to do the same.
> To check if student's homeworks have logical (not syntactic) overlap, we use automated tools.
> We have caught numerous people cheating in the past in this way.
> This is the **quickest and surest way to fail the class**.
> If you feel pressured about an assignment, please come see me instead of cheating.

Please read the CS department's academic honesty policies in `cs_integrity.md`.

Generally, in this class you should **not** 
> discuss details of homeworks with other students, and all work that you hand it must be your own,
> see another student's code,
> collaborate between groups is allowed (for any group assignments),
> use code generation tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot, etc.

Any exceptions to this rule-of-thumb will be made by the professor/TA.
If there is any ambiguity as to if a certain behavior is acceptable according to the academic honesty requirements, raise your concern on Discord or with the professor (not the TA).

I want to be very clear:

- If you see the code of another student (who is not in your group), you are cheating.
- If you *share* your code with any other student (not in your group), you are cheating.
- If you use ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot or any other code generation frameworks that have existed in the past, now or may be developed in the future, you are cheating.
    Note that this applies even after you have taken the class.

In the past, the only way that people have failed this class is to either not try (not do homeworks), or to cheat.
There is almost *no reason* to cheat.
Come to me, and we can discuss where you're at, and what you have to do to make it through this difficult class!

# Specification

Please create a file in this repository called `integrity_agreement.txt` (the name must match exactly).

The contents of that file must include the following (please copy and paste):

> I have read and understand the academic integrity policies relevant to this class including the `cs_integrity.md` file.
> I agree to adhere to these policies throughout this course and understand that any deviation from this will have adverse consequences to my standing in the class, and possibly in the university.

Please only complete this assignment as specified if you do agree to this statement.
We will consider the submission of this statement as a digital signature validating your agreement.
